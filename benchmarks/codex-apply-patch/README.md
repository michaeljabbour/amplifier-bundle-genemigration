# codex-apply-patch — frozen answer-key benchmark (Loop 2 pilot)

The **technique-level objective function** for GM (see `../../docs/EVALUATION.md`
Loop 2): a real historical port graded from OUTSIDE the loop.

## Scenario

`openai/codex` was ported TypeScript→Rust. Frozen at tag `rust-v0.0.2504301219`:

- **Source (shown to the flow):** the pre-port TypeScript apply-patch slice —
  `upstream/ts/` (`apply-patch.ts`, `parse-apply-patch.ts` + their TS tests,
  Apache-2.0, © OpenAI). The flow ports this to a Rust crate.
- **Answer key (NEVER shown to the flow):** the real Rust port — `upstream/rs/`
  (`codex-rs/apply-patch` at the same tag). Used only to harvest grader cases
  and to calibrate.

## The fixed CLI contract (the 1:1 adaptation)

Candidate ports must expose a binary that: reads the full patch envelope
(`*** Begin Patch … *** End Patch`) from **stdin**, applies changes relative to
**cwd**, exits **0 iff the patch applied**, non-zero otherwise. stdout/stderr are
not graded. The same contract wraps the real implementation for calibration
(`calibration/` — a thin shim over `codex_apply_patch::apply_patch`).

## Grading

`cases/cases.json` — 21 black-box cases harvested from the answer key's own test
suite (mapping + adaptations in `cases/HARVEST_NOTES.md`):
11 success-path · 5 parse-invalid (exit≠0) · 5 `quirk_*` cases pinning the real
implementation's **discovered** behavior: runtime failures (context mismatch,
nonexistent file) exit **0** silently, and application is **non-atomic across
hunks**. Verified empirically before encoding — the cases encode what the answer
key DOES, not what seems ideal.

```sh
cd calibration && cargo build --release && cd ..
python3 grade.py --bin calibration/target/release/codex-apply-patch-shim   # calibration: 21/21
python3 grade.py --bin <candidate-binary> --json results.json              # grade a port
```

**Calibration result: `SCORE: 21/21`** against the real codex-rs implementation.

## Scoring nuance — report the breakdown, not just the total

The `quirk_*` cases measure fidelity to the ANSWER KEY, whose edge behavior may
itself diverge from the TS source (the real port changed/embraced these
semantics). A flow that faithfully ports TS behavior can legitimately fail
quirk cases while being a good migration of the SOURCE. Always report:
success-path score, invalid-handling score, and quirk score separately —
the headline number is the success-path + invalid score; quirks are a fidelity
signal about WHICH implementation the port resembles.

## Threats (named, not glossed)

- **Contamination:** codex is in frontier-model training data; a model may
  recall codex-rs. Use v1-vs-v2 DELTAS on this same frozen task as the primary
  number (recall inflates both arms); prefer obscure/private answer keys for
  trustworthy absolutes. Residual: this repo vendors the answer key under
  `upstream/rs/` — scenario materialization must copy ONLY `upstream/ts/` into
  the environment the flow can reach.
- **Contract fixture:** the CLI contract is ours, not codex's — both the real
  implementation (via the shim) and candidates are graded through the identical
  contract, so the comparison stays fair.

## Running the benchmark (pilot shape)

1. Materialize the scenario: source repo = `upstream/ts/` files + a README
   stating the contract; target = empty Rust repo (`TARGET_KIND=new:rust`).
2. Run GM (inventory → migrate to quiescence) in an isolated DTU. The flow never
   sees `upstream/rs/` or `cases/`.
3. Build the produced crate; `python3 grade.py --bin <produced-binary>`.
4. Compare GM-v1 vs GM-v2 on THIS same frozen scenario, K≥3 repeats per variant
   (single-run inventories are nondeterministic — observed 3-story vs 6-story
   backlogs from an identical toy source).
